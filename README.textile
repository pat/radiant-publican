h1. Publican

An extension influenced by the similar "Layout Layer":http://github.com/freelancing-god/radiant-layout-layer, this one copies any public files for all extensions on every page load in development mode only.

This is useful when you're developing other extensions which have public files (javascripts, stylesheets, etc), and you're regularly editing them and then have to run the rake task to update them _all_ the time.

It's the equivalent of running @rake radiant:extensions:update_all@ before every request.
